This is one of my old project found while recovering data from a old hdd.
just a algorithim visualizer made with c++ and WxWidgets. At first it worked but later tried to improve it by using threading and never finished it.
There are 2 release. 
  One is in folder "OldVirson", it has all the algorithims working but fixed delay so for quick or radix sort you have to take a very learge array to able to see something.
  Second is a later built version in folder "x64\Release", it has a adjustable delay to slow down the sorting to see animations. But Here only first 3 algorithims are working.

I am not sure the current code will run. And forgot about what changes made after those 2 releases.
To run the application just download the exe and run it.
